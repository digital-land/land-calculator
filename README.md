A demonstration of using planning data to estimate land is unconstrained and potentially suitable for development.

# Roadmap

* <s>speed up processing</s>
  - <s>split excludes by LPA</s>
  - <s>combine shapes and have a single intersection</s>
* <s>build data nationally</s>
* <s>style polgons less bold, make more transparent</s>
* <s>update hectares to match filters</s>
* <s>estitimate number of dwellings based on [gentle density](https://www.createstreets.com/why-should-we-build-more-georgian-terraces/)</s>
* <s>exclude [NSIP](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/infrastructure-project)</s>
* remove lines, slivers and other artifacts
  - remove sites < 37m<sup>2</sup> in size
  - remove shapes with a low [thinness ratio](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1336265/explanation-of-the-thinness-ratio-formula)
  - remove Line, LineStrings and simplify GeometryCollections
* include/exclude sites in green-belt option
* sites within green-belt option
* sites within 200m of a built up area
* split golf course from green-space
* within 15 minutes from ONS isochrones [map](https://pbarber.github.io/uk-isochrones-map/)
* within 800m of a main-line railway station
* shard by LPA, not just LAD (National parks span regions)
* detailed report of size of the areas per-LPA
* popup showing LPA, area, etc for each shape
* a link to the current view to https://planning.data.gov.uk/map
* use OS Zoomstack rather than ONS built up areas
* exclude OS Zoomstack surface water
* exclude OS Zoomstack foreshore
* exclude OS Zoomstack railways (buffered)
* exclude OS Zoomstack rivers (buffered)
* exclude OS Zoomstack schools (sites of type "Education")
* exclude OS Zoomstack hospitals and clinics (sites of type "Medical Care")
* exclude agricultural land with a high [ALC grade](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-land-assess-proposals-for-development/guide-to-assessing-development-proposals-on-agricultural-land)
* stacked bar chart of land use in selected areas

# Rebuilding the data

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python [requirements](requirements.txt), [makerules](https://github.com/digital-land/makerules) and other dependencies. Requires Make v4.0 or above.

    $ make makerules
    $ make init
    $ make
